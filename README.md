This is my solution to the Mobile Flashcards project of the [React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

I used [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) for styling and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage state.

Since I did not have an iOS device, I made the app for Android, using the [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) emulator.

Tested in Google Nexus 5X (emulator) and Moto E5.

## Running it

1. Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leovant/reactnd-mobile-flashcards.git
```

2. Access the directory and install dependencies:

```bash
$ cd <project_directory>
$ yarn
```

3. Start the app:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This project was bootstrapped and built with [Expo](https://expo.io/).

The app is available at https://expo.io/@leovant/reactnd-mobile-flashcards.
